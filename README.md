# Hackathon

Login to your account in Google Collabs. Upload the ipynb files.
You should follow the directions for the Capture the Flag. The ipynb files, are Jupyter Notebooks that provide you all the information. You can always do research on the Internet to solve the challenges.

Once you find the flags you submit to the platform. You can try multiple times to submit, there is no penalty.

The main idea is that you read and experiment. Do not go fast to solve the challenges. The final comppetition (next Hackathon) will be set up with a different scoreboard.
